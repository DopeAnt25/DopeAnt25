## Some of the projects I've worked on
- [_Green House project for NWMSU_](https://github.com/44440-f23/greenhouse-frontend)
    - I worked on the front of this project doing most of the work on the settings page and the styling of the website overall.
- [_First person shooter game_](https://github.com/44351-w23/final-project-apl-studios)
    - I worked on almost all of the scripts on this game using the godot game engine, following the godot documentation for the first person shooter game.
- [_Android School Calendar App_](https://github.com/EmeraldKnight2814/Perfect_Planner)
    - I worked on mostly just the backend on this one which consisted of keeping the entered data locally on the device even when the phone itself shuts off or the app is closed.
